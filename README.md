# Termux Prediction & 999okwin Simulator (Web)

This small single-page web tool reproduces the features from your provided shell and Python snippets in HTML/CSS/JS.

Features:
- Prediction panel: type a period number and it computes:
  - Color (RED/GREEN/VIOLET) based on period % 3
  - Number result (period % 10)
  - Probability computed from (period * 371) % 1000 then % 100, adjusted to look more realistic (if <65 add 35)
  - A message showing high/moderate/low chance

- 999okwin Hack Simulator:
  - Simulated matrix effect
  - Multiple progress bars (Scanning, Connecting, Extracting, Encrypting, Transferring, Decrypting)
  - Random initial and final accuracy similar to your scripts
  - Result symbol (ðŸŸ¢ or ðŸ”´)
  - A downloadable log file containing the simulated steps

How to run:
1. Put `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `app.js` in the same folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.

Notes & next steps:
- Everything runs client-side; no server required.
- If you want the simulator to be more faithful to the original CLI look, I can add ANSI-style fonts, sound effects, or more realistic timing/phrases.
- If you want to persist logs or add authentication (like your Python Google Authenticator), I can add a small server component or localStorage support.
